Read $1 and interview me using AskUserQuestion to surface hidden assumptions and gaps.

Probe across all dimensions:
- **Product**: Who's the user? What's the core value? What can we cut?
- **UX/UI**: How does it feel? What's confusing? First-time vs power user?
- **Business**: Pricing impact? Competitive angle? Support burden?
- **Technical**: Feasibility? Dependencies? What breaks at scale?
- **Edge cases**: Empty states, errors, limits, abuse vectors

Ask 1-2 sharp questions per round. Skip the obvious. Dig into hand-wavy answers.

When gaps are addressed, update the file with a refined spec.
