description: Review this codebase against LLM/AI coding principles and summarize recommended refactors, deletions, and structural improvements by priority.

<task>
  <goal>
    Check your LLM, AI coding principles and then do a comprehensive search of this application and suggest what we can do to refactor this to better align to those principles.
  </goal>

  <also>
    Also point out any code that can be deleted, any files that can be deleted, things that should read should be renamed, things that should be restructured.
  </also>

  <deliverable>
    Then do a write up of what that looks like.
  </deliverable>

  <style>
    Kind of keep it high level so that it's easy for me to read and not too complex.
  </style>

  <priorities>
    Add sections for high, medium and lower priority
  </priorities>

  <constraints>
    And if something doesn't need to be changed, then don't change it. You don't need to change things just for the sake of changing them. You only need to change them if it helps better align to your LLM AI coding principles.
  </constraints>

  <output>
    Save to a markdown file FINDINGS.md
